# LootEverything
This is a client side mod that requires MelonLoader version 0.3.0 (WILL NOT WORK UNLESS YOU HAVE THIS VERSION)

The mod adds a very simple display in the top left side of your game showing 3 values. 
1. The amount of bots alive in the raid
2. The total amount of loose loot items in your raid
3. The total amount of lootable containers that have loot inside of them

This is not a cheat tool, it will not tell you where said bots, loose loot, or containers with loot are. It will not tell you what's inside the containers or anything like that.
This is simply a tool to help you know if you missed any items/containers as well as let you know if bots are still spawning, how many bots are there.
